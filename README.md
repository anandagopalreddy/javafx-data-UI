This repository demonstrates a fully functional JavaFX desktop application that integrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a relational database using JDBC. It serves as a foundational project for developers who want to build database-driven applications with a user-friendly JavaFX interface.

The application allows users to seamlessly add, view, update, and delete records in a connected SQL database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite). The frontend is built with JavaFX, offering a clean and responsive user interface that supports smooth interaction and real-time updates.

In addition to CRUD functionality, the application includes a login and authentication system that securely verifies user credentials before granting access. This ensures that only authorized users can interact with the system, adding a layer of security to your desktop application.

Another key feature is the ability to export data to Excel files, allowing users to download and share the stored records in a structured, easy-to-analyze format. This is particularly useful for reporting, backups, or offline record-keeping.

This project includes robust exception handling, input validation, and follows a modular code structure for better readability and maintainability. It can serve as a boilerplate for building systems like student record management, inventory systems, or customer data dashboards.

The tech stack used in this project includes Java (11 or higher), JavaFX for the user interface, and JDBC for database connectivity. Optionally, Scene Builder can be used to visually design the UI components.

This project is ideal for students, beginners, or professionals who are learning how to integrate JavaFX with backend databases or who need a template for quickly setting up secure, feature-rich, database-connected desktop applications.
